Tarot Three Ways 

Over the years I have had interests in Tarot cards as well as the Digital Interactive arts, as I learned them both I practiced them both. Here is a collection of Tarot applications that I have made over the years. 

Newb JS Tarot
This was the first Tarot application that I made for the web browser.  The code is awkward and probably buggy, but I include it because it marks a begining.

Flex-Tarot
This example is much more interesting. It is the first time I played around with Object Oriented Code and the concept of skins.

MVC JS Tarot
The latest example has been an exploration into using the Asynchronous Module Definition to package the code as well as MVC framework Ember.js. This is still a work in progress. The plan is to make the layout responsive for different display options; add HTML5 local storage to save readings; extend the API to for many different spread types;
