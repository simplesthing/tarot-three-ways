Tarot Three Ways 

Over the years I have had interests in Tarot cards as well as Interactive arts, as I learned them both I practiced them both. Here is a collection of Tarot applications that I have made over the years. 

Newb JS Tarot
This was the first Tarot application that I made for the web browser. The code is awkward and probably buggy, it uses old school alerts to display the card readings, and my DOM.load method is deprecated for the XMLHttpRequest object, but I include it because it marks a begining. Circa 2008.

Flex
This example is much more interesting. It is the first time I played around with Object Oriented Code and the concept of skins. I used ActioScript 3 and the Flex Builder Application to build up MVC architecture using components, events, skins and value Objects. If you right click the example in a web browser you will can view the full source. Circa 2010

MVC JS Tarot
The latest example has been an exploration into using the Asynchronous Module Definition and Require.js to package the code as well as the JavaScript MVC library Ember.js to create the classes. This application was inspired by Facebook widgets, where a simple excerpt of code copied into any web page will insert the application ansychronously. This is still a work in progress, at the moment the console is the only text output for card meanings.
 The plan is to make the layout responsive for different display options; add HTML5 local storage to save readings; extend the API to for many different spread types; Circa 2012
